## 👉🏻 Introduction

**Streamify** is a video streaming platform developed using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The project focuses on building a scalable and functional video streaming site similar to popular platforms, with features like user authentication, video management, subscriptions, comments, likes, and more.

## 💻 Design of the Solution

### User Authentication
- New users can **register** using a username, email ID, and password.
- Existing users can **log in** using their email and password to manage profiles.
- Password Reset functionality via email-based verification.

### Video Management
- Users can **upload**, **view**, **comment**, and **like** videos.
- Videos display total **views** and can be **searched** by keywords.

### Subscriptions
- Users can **subscribe** to other users to receive updates on their uploads.

### Comments and Replies
- Users can **comment** on videos and reply to other comments.

### Likes & Views
- Users can **like** the videos and track video **views**.

### Search Functionality
- Users can **search** for videos by entering keywords related to the content.
